        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
        I, Zoe E. Potts, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall WEB250-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Professor D.I.
        </p>
        <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put 
        information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in 
        assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
